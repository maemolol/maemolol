# welcome to my github page!

here you'll find mostly my dumb shit like:
* my collection of programs i dump on here
* my website's code
* old locales for sudomemo (as in the flipnote hatena revival service)
* and (most *fucking* importantly) my "coding" attempts as a child (for context i joined github when i was 8)

oh, here's like a brief description of me: i'm a 15 year old non-binary person (they/them) that likes coding a lot. i also made some friends over the years, like [lux](https://nixgoat.me), [j0](https://j0.lol) and [luna](https://github.com/lunaisnotaboy)
